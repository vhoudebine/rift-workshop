    "### 🔑 Concept: 5 Ways to Interact with Tecton\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 ways of interacting with Tecton:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Tecton Web UI:** The Tecton Web UI is where you can browse, discover, and monitor all of the data sources, features, and more that have been registered with the cluster using `tecton apply`. This is where you can discover other features in your organization that may be helpful for you model or check on the materialization statuses of new features.\n",
    "2. **The Tecton SDK with Notebook Driven Development:** Tecton's SDK allows you to rapidly experiment with new features views and data sources within a notebook environment.  Tecton's SDK can be used in any EMR or Databricks notebook (like this one!) to fetch data from the Feature Store. This includes things like previewing feature data, testing transformations, and building training data sets. Currently the SDK requires a Spark Context, but soon we will offer support for using the Tecton SDK from a local notebook without Spark.\n",
    "3. **The Tecton Feature Repo and CLI:** Data sources, features, and feature sets are all defined as python configuration files in a local \"Feature Repo\" typically backed by git (such as the one you cloned earlier). These definitions are then applied to a workspace in a Tecton cluster using the CLI command `tecton apply`. This will be one of the most common CLI commands you will use.\n",
    "4. **The Tecton REST API:** Tecton's REST API is used for fetching the latest feature values in production for model inference. This endpoint typically returns a feature vector in ~5 milliseconds.\n",
    "5. **The Tecton API Client:** Tecton's Python and Java API clients make using the REST API easy."
